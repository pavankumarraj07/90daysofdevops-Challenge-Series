What is File management and Directory management?
```
File Management:

File management refers to the process of creating, organizing, storing, manipulating, and deleting files on a computer or other electronic devices. It involves managing files in a way that makes them easily accessible, searchable, and secure.

File management involves several tasks, including creating new files, organizing them into directories or folders, renaming, copying, moving or deleting files, and setting permissions to control who can access or modify the files. Additionally, file management involves backing up and archiving files to prevent data loss in case of disasters, such as hardware failures, viruses, or accidental deletion.

Good file management practices can help users find files more quickly and easily, avoid data loss or corruption, and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Examples of file management tools include the File Explorer in Windows, Finder in macOS, and command-line tools in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

Directory Management:

Directory management, also known as folder management, is the process of creating, organizing, manipulating, and deleting directories or folders on a computer or other electronic devices. A directory or folder is a container for files and other directories, allowing users to organize their data in a hierarchical manner.

Directory management involves several tasks, including creating new directories or folders, organizing them into a logical structure, renaming, moving or deleting directories, and setting permissions to control who can access or modify the directories.

Overall, File and Directory management is an essential component of using a computer, and mastering this skill can help users better manage their data, improve productivity, and keep their files secure.

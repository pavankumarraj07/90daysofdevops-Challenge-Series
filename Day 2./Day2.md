Basic Linux Commands

## What is Command in general and in technical terms?
In general:
```
A command is an instruction or order given to someone or something to do something.
Examples: "Stand Up", "Sit Down", "Talk To Me"
```

In technical terms:
```
A command is a specific instruction given to a computer or other electronic device to perform a particular action. Commands are often entered using a command line interface (CLI), which allows the user to interact with the computer by typing in text-based commands rather than using a graphical user interface (GUI).

Examples:

In the Windows Command Prompt, the command "dir" is used to display a list of files and folders in the current directory.

In Unix and Linux systems, the command "ls" is used to list the files and directories in the current working directory.

The command "cd" is used to change the current working directory in both Windows and Unix-based systems.

In Git, the version control system, the command "git commit" is used to save changes to a repository.

In Python programming language, the command "print" is used to output text or data to the console.
